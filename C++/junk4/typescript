// Filename:     prog04.cpp
// Author:       Mathew Walker, CS116, Winter 2015
// Description:  This program creates a chatterbox named Dr. Chat that will respond to user input, allowing
//               the user to have a conversation. The program loops until the user enters nothing twice or says bye.
//               The program recognizes some user inputs and has random responses for other inputs.
//DESIGN
    //1. Preprocessor directives
    //2. Function declaration(prototype) and variable declaration
    //3. DEFINES function used to select random responses
    //4. OPENS main function
    //5. DECLARES variables
    //6.Loops until function returns 0
    //  7a. GETS user input and sets to variable userinput
    //  7b. GOES through function process input and returns 1 or 0
    //8. Function definition for processInput, processes userinput to either have a planned response,
    //   random response, or end the program.
